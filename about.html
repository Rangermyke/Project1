    <h1>This is some info about me.</h1>

    <p>My name is Michael and I work as a Sr. Marketing Specialist in Baltimore. I am originally from California. I grew up surfing my entire life and miss it.</p>

    <p>I wanted to take this class to learn HTML and CSS because I maintain our website at work, and a lot of the time, I run into issues that need a little more help. To streamline the process, I decided to learn it myself to save time. So I started to build my <a href="index.html">first webpage</a> section by section. You can find more on my <a href="https://github.com/Rangermyke">github profile</a></p>
